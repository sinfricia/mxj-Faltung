 *
 * This is an ultra basic FaltungOaA. Also, it's not really working, even though I think the principle is implemented correctly. It's probably just way too slow!
 * It uses the basic convolution sum (no FFT or similar things are used) and the overlap and add method.
 *
 * You can load an impulse response (IR) through the 'buffer~' object in the maxpatch. It is then stored in an array by the mxj.
 *
 * The input is written to a buffer padded by (IRLenngth - 1) zeroes on each end. This buffer is then convolved with the IR and the result is written to 1 of 2 output buffers.
 * These output buffers are used one after the other and the first (IRLength - 1) samples of the currently used buffer are added with the (IRLength - 1) last samples of the other
 * buffer (which were calculated previously). These are the samples where, when we calculate the convolution, the IR overlaps with the added zeroes and therefor isn't complete.
 * In this way we should in theory convolve every part of the input singal with the IR. Sadly it doesn't sound quite right yet and there are many things which could cause the problem...
 *
 * One thing is sure though: This is a veeeeeery slow convolver so don't even try to load IR's longer than about 500 samples.
